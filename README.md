# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

### Context & Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a pervasive issue in the financial sector. According to the **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)**, it is defined as "the unauthorized use of a credit or debit card, or similar payment tool (ACH, EFT, recurring charge, etc.), to fraudulently obtain money or property." These illicit activities often stem from stolen card numbers obtained through unsecured websites or identity theft schemes.

### The Scale of the Issue
The financial impact of fraud is substantial. The **FTC's Consumer Sentinel Network Data Book 2019** ranked credit card fraud as the top identity theft report, with over 271,000 specific cases of information misuse. Furthermore, the **Nilson Report (Nov 2019)** indicated that global losses amounted to **$27.85 billion**. Notably, the United States accounted for 33.99% of these gross losses ($9.47 billion), despite representing only 21.54% of global transactions.

## Project Objectives
With data breaches becoming increasingly common, financial institutions must adopt proactive measures to detect anomalies. In this notebook, we will explore various Machine Learning models to tackle this problem.

**Our main goals are:**
1.  Analyze the provided dataset for patterns and anomalies.
2.  Preprocess the data to handle class imbalance (Fraud vs. Normal).
3.  Train and evaluate multiple classification algorithms.
4.  Determine the most effective model for real-time fraud detection.
